# Build and run

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.17.x
- yarn >= 1.22.x

## Running the code

We use yarn as a package management tool for development and building, and it is highly recommended that you do the same, but if you want to use npm it's perfectly fine, it just might take a little more time to install dependencies.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you want to improve Angular development efficiency, you can install the command-line Angular-cli officially provided by Angular to quickly generate templates such as components and services.

```
yarn add @angular/cli --global
```
