MakeNSISW - MakeNSIS Windows Wrapper
----------------------------------------------------


About MakeNSISW
---------------
MakeNSISW is a wrapper for the NSIS compiler (MakeNSIS).
MakeNSISW allows you to compile NSIS scripts using a Windows GUI interface.


Requirements
------------
MakeNSISW requires NSIS be installed on your system.  The default 
directory for this installation is $PROGRAMFILES\NSIS\Contrib\MakeNSISW.


Usage:
------
If you installed the Shell Extensions option during the installation, then
all that is required is that you choose 'Compile NSI' from the right-
click menu on a NSIS script.  This will invoke MakeNSISW.

The format of the parameters when calling MakeNSISW from the commandline is:
  makensisw [options] [script.nsi | - [...]]

For the options, please see the MakeNSIS documentation.
