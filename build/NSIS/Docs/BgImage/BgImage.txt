BgImage.DLL - NSIS extension DLL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays an image or a gradient with user defined texts and/or images behind the NSIS window.
Can also play WAVs.

See Example.nsi for a usage example.

Usage
~~~~~

1) Call SetBg to set the background
2) Call AddText, or AddImage to add texts and images
3) Call Redraw to update the background window
4) Optional - repeat steps 2-3 to add more images
           -or-
   call Clear and repeat steps 1-3 for a completely new background.
5) Call Destroy when the background is no longer required (.onGUIEnd for example)

Notes
~~~~~

* This plugin requires NSIS 2.42 and above.

* Do not call SetBg (which creates the window) from a section or a function called by a section.
   BgImge must be run from the GUI thread as the installation thread is not built to handle GUI.

Available functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SetBg [/FILLSCREEN|/TILED] path_to_bitmap
SetBg /GRADIENT R G B R G B
   Sets the background and creates the window if necessary
   Use /FILLSCREEN to make the image fill the screen
   Use /TILED to set a tiled background
   Use /GRADIENT to set a gradient background

   If SetReturn on was called returns "success" on the stack
     or an error string if there was an error

   Do not use in .onInit!

AddImage [/TRANSPARENT R G B] path_to_bitmap X Y
   Adds an image to the background window at (X,Y)
     X and Y can be negative to specify distance from right/bottom
   Use /TRANSPARENT to make BgImage draw the image transparently
     Define the transparent color using R G B

   If SetReturn on was called returns "success" on the stack
     or an error string if there was an error

AddText text font_handle R G B X Y X Y
  Adds text to the background window
  Use NSIS's CreateFont to create a font and pass it as font_handle
  Use R G B to set the text color
  The first X Y is for the top left corner of the text box
  The second X Y is for the bottom right corner of the text box
  X and Y can be negative to specify distance from right/bottoms

  If SetReturn on was called returns "success" on the stack
     or an error string if there was an error

Clear
   Clears all of the current background, images and texts

Destroy
   Destroys the current background window
   Destroy calls Clear automatically

Sound [/WAIT|/LOOP] path_to_wav
Sound /STOP
   Plays a wave file
   Use /WAIT to wait for the sound to finish playing
   Use /LOOP to loop the sound
   Use Sound /STOP to stop the loop

SetReturn on|off
   Enable return values from SetBg, AddImage and AddText
   Default value is off because all of the possible errors
     are either things you should handle when debugging your script
     such as "can't load bitmap" or errors you can do nothing about
     such as "memory allocation error"
